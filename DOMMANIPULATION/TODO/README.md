# Dynamic Todo List

## Description
Create a simple todo list where users can:

- Add new tasks through an input field.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Remove tasks with a delete button next to each item.
- The list updates dynamically without page refresh.

## Requirements
- Use `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, and `remove` for DOM operations.
- Use event listeners for clicking tasks and delete buttons.
- **Bonus:** Change the style of completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough).

## Example
1. Input: “Buy groceries” → Click **Add** → List updates with a new item.
2. Click on “Buy groceries” → Text gets a strikethrough.
3. Click the delete button → Item disappears.
